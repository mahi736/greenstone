				<p>The environment is precious and has existed in a remarkable state to allow humans to thrive. We are
					dependent on the environment for our basic needs. There is a balanced natural cycle that exists
					between the environment and human beings.Human beings have started overusing natural resources and
					have broken this natural balance. Human societies are playing a vital role in upsetting the
					conditions for wildlife and the wellbeing of the environment that allows humans, sea life and
					mammals to thrive. The result: the planet we live in is suffering deforestation, pollution,
					extinction of various species and rising temperatures.Human actions directly affect the planet in
					general. So, we should prevent it for the betterment of us. If you are interested to work for the
					nature, you can join with us and be a part of the organisation.</p>

				<p>The climate change is now the headline of the new world. People are now divided into two groups.One
					says climate change matters, and the other one doesn't even care.Then why do I care? I care because
					the gradual change of a region’s climate brings a drastic change in the environment. The usual
					weather conditions are not seen. Some different conditions of the weather are observed. The regions
					with an average amount of rainfall receive more amounts or fewer amounts of rainfall.The conditions
					of a climate in a region which were considered to be that regions speciality are also changing. The
					plants and animals which survived in a particular climate are facing difficulties in their
					survival.The main cause of the change of climate is global warming. It is the main cause which is
					making the symptoms of the weather conditions of a climate different for the existing species.If you
					really love the world then you can't sit in your couch and talk against these changes. So be a
					nature lover, save your home, your world.</p>

				<p>Global temperatures and sea levels are rising, and possibly contributing to large more devastating

					in all the interconnected Weather elements on our planet over approxiamately 30 years. This is
					really bad.Now it is we have to Safe our nature . Science has never been clearer, Awareness has
					never been greater. Its time for decisive action. People and nature can thrive Together. But Only if
					the World comes Together Quickly in the same way it did to tackle Climate change. Nature has given
					so much Gifts to us Such as, air, water, land, Sun light, minerals, plants and animals. All these
					gifts of nature make our earth a Place worth living. But now Climate change is distroying it. Í
					think first of All we have to plant more tress and have to encourage people to come Forward to Work
					in this topic.It is necessary to contribute towards lowering air pollution. We must use shared
					transport and employing rainwater harvesting systems to conserve nature Therefore, Taking
					appropriate Steps to conserve nature in its untouched form.It must be a priority for the Human
